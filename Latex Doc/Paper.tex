\section{Dataset}
We have chosen to scrape Reddit for posts in the following subreddits:\\
r/:macapps, learnprogramming, learntodraw, learnpython, learnmath, LaTeX, Python, datascience, dataengineering, malefashionadvice, MachineLearning, ObsidianMD, neuroscience, printSF, science, ios, MacOS and mac.\\
We have chosen these subreddits, as we have noticed that they have a high amount of "question posts" (posts that have one or more correct answers).\\

We have scraped the data using python, and the following main libraries: 'selenium' and 'BeautifulSoup' (the code can be found in the github repository provided).
